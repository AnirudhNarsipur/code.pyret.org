<h3>How do we use your Google account?</h3>

<p> We ask for what appears as three permissions <b>View and manage Google
Drive files that you have opened or created with this app,</b> <b>View your
email</b>, and <b>Know who you are on Google</b>. These permissions let us
create files in your Drive, and update those files later.  Also, if in the
future we provide a way for you to directly upload Pyret files and load them
into <code>code.pyret.org</code> from your Drive, you can explicitly grant
permission for this application to view and edit certain files.  We need to
know your identity because this is the only way we've found to reliably give
you persistent access to saving to Drive that doesn't expire and require
popping up new windows while you're editing.</p>

<p> You can always go to <a
href="https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions?pli=1">https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions?pli=1</a>
and immediately remove all access that we have to your account.  Your programs
and <code>code.pyret.org</code> folder will <em>not</em> be deleted if you do
so, but you can always manually delete the folder and its contents yourself.
</p>



<h3>Where are things stored in my Drive?</h3>

<p>
We initially make a single folder in your Google Drive, called
<code>code.pyret.org</code>, and store all of your programs there, with the
names you choose for them.  They are all created with you as the owner, and
private to your account.
</p>

<p>
If you <em>share</em> programs, we create a new folder, called
<code>code.pyret.org.shared</code>, and we make a <em>publicly-readable
copy</em> of any programs you share in that directory.  If you delete this
files in this folder, links for those programs you have shared with others
will stop working, but any copies others have made will be theirs to keep.
Each time you share a program, a new copy is created from its current
contents.
</p>

<p> We can only see files that we created, so simply moving another file into
your <code>code.pyret.org</code> collection won’t cause it to show up in our
interface: you need to create the file manually through our editor.  </p>

<p> The listing of programs in this application only looks for the
<code>code.pyret.org</code> folder and its contents, so if you rename or remove
that folder, a new, empty one will be created for you on your next login.</p>

<h3 id="logging">What information is sent back to the Pyret team?</h3>
<p>By default, Pyret records basic information about your use of code.pyret.org
(CPO) to give us the background we need to improve the language. As you use use
CPO, we take note of whether you are running with the type checker or not, and
what errors you encounter.</p>

<p>Under the
<button class="blueButton" style=" display: inline-block;float:initial;">More ▾</button>
menu, you can opt-in to contributing more detailed information. If you choose
to contribute detailed information, CPO will additionally send us data about
what kind of edits you make to your program. We analyze this information to help
us understand whether the error messages you recieve succeed in helping you
reach a solution.</p>
