    <p>We are experimenting using <a target="_blank" href="https://webgazer.cs.brown.edu/">webgazer.js</a>
        to track users' eyes to improve our programming environment.
        Specifically, we wish to see how participants use our error messages and how effective our error messages are.
    </p>
    <p>
        We have a reputation of respecting and maintaining our users' privacy.
        We aim to continue this.
        All computation is done on your computer--there is no webcam-caught image or video data lying around on some server.
        <a target="_blank" href="https://webgazer.cs.brown.edu/">Webgazer</a> goes into more detail on this.
        We store the predicted location of where you are looking on the screen as well as the time information.
        Anything else is extrapolated from this data.
    </p>
    <p>
        Participation and giving us access to your webcam is completely opt-in.
        In the editor view, a dialogue should open asking if you want to grant us access.
        If you do not, simply ignore this dialogue box.
        It should disappear shortly.
        Note that if you do grant us access,
        your browser will probably verify that you do mean to allow us access to your webcam.
        Click confirm.
        We appreciate your help!
