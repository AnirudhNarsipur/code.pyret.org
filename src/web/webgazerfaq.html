            We are using <a target="_blank" href="https://webgazer.cs.brown.edu/">webgazer.js</a>
            to learn more about how users interact with Pyret.
            Our ultimate goal is to improve the user experience.
        </p>

        <h2>What about my privacy?</h2>
        <p>
            We have a reputation of respecting and maintaining our users' privacy.
            We continue to take this seriously.
            <a target="_blank" href="https://webgazer.cs.brown.edu/">Webgazer.js</a>
            assures us that no images will ever leave your machine.
            We only receive the predictions of where you are looking and the corresponding timestamps.
            Nevertheless, if you believe you have found a violation,
            please immediately inform both
            <a target="_blank" href="https://webgazer.cs.brown.edu/#contact">webgazer</a>
            and
            <a href="mailto:skynetfalling@brownplt.com">us</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Do I have to participate?</h2>
        <p>
            Participating and giving us access to your webcam is completely opt-in.
            In the
            <a target="_blank" href="/editor">editor view</a>,
            a dialogue will ask if you want to grant us access.
            It will disappear when you either grant or deny access.
            Note that if you do grant us access,
            your browser will probably verify that you do mean to allow us access to your webcam.
            Please click confirm.
        </p>
        <p>
            We thank you for participating in making Pyret a better system for all.
        </p>
        <h2>How do I reset my preferences?</h2>
        <p>
            You can 
            <a href="javascript:resetAccessPreferences()">reset your access preferences</a>
            if you want to change your preferences next time you access the editor.
        </p>

        <h2>How do I stop allowing access?</h2>
        <p>
            First, you need to 
            <a href="javascript:resetAccessPreferences()">reset your access preferences</a>
            so the next time you access the editor it will ask you if you want to grant us access again.
            Deny access, and you will be good to go!
        </p>

        <h2>How do I change to allow access?</h2>
        <p>
            First, you need to 
            <a href="javascript:resetAccessPreferences()">reset your access preferences</a>
            so the next time you access the editor it will ask you if you want to grant us access again.
            Allow access, and you will be good to go!
        </p>

        <h2>How do I stop warning messages from popping up?</h2>
        <p>
            Such an occasion might occur when you grant us access,
            but we still cannot access webcam information.
            For example, you might not be using a
            <a target="_blank" href="https://webgazer.cs.brown.edu/#support">supported browser</a>
            or your browser might be blocking access to your webcam.
            Verify that your browser is not blocking access.
        </p>

        <p>
            If this is not the case,
            <a href="javascript:resetAccessPreferences()">reset your access preferences</a>
            then next time you are in the editor,
            deny access.
            We appreciate your willingness to help.
            Remember to change your preferences when you get a better spyglass!
